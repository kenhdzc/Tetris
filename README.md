# Tetris

This game was made in C# with WPF

First of all I made the grid. The grid has 20 rows and 10 columns and I added 2 more rows for the spawning blocks. Empty cells are on zero and the blocks are starting with 1 for example the blue block has the number 3 and the red one 7. If a row is full it will be cleared and the other rows will go one down.
Then I made the 7 Blocks with their block rotations. After that I made the Movement with just changing the offset.
The next step was to make a random bock pick then I started to make the game.
For The game I setted the right spawning position, if the block is in the grid and the game over.
The next step was to importing the assets for block and background to make the UI
Then I made the key presses and if the game should be over you the game shouldnt react to the keys anymore.
Then I made a game loop the restart the game after a game over.
The game was done and I added some features like hghscore or a clock, a hold feature, a harddrop feature and to increase the difficulty in game
